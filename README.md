This is an AI-powered system that autonomously generates test cases from requirements and specifications.
This application is built with Next.js and Google's Gemini models.

## Features

- **Document Upload and Parsing**: Paste requirement documents and parse the content.
- **AI-Powered Understanding**: Employs AI to analyze content and extract key requirements, constraints, and objectives.
- **Interactive Flowchart Visualization**: Generates a dynamic flowchart to visually represent the interpreted logic.
- **Agentic Test Case Generation**: Triggers an AI agent to iteratively generate comprehensive test cases.
- **Compliance Standard Mapping**: Automatically maps generated test cases to relevant compliance standards (e.g., FDA, IEC 62304).
