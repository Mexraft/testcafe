# **App Name**: AutoTestify

## Core Features:

- Document Upload and Parsing: Allow users to upload requirement documents (PDF, Word, etc.) or paste problem statements, and parse the content into structured data.
- AI-Powered Understanding and Summarization: Employ Gemini to analyze the uploaded content and extract key requirements, constraints, and objectives, presenting a summarized understanding to the user.
- Interactive Flowchart Visualization: Generate a dynamic flowchart visually representing the understanding of the requirements, allowing users to review, edit, and confirm the interpreted logic.
- Test Case Generation (Agentic Mode): Trigger an agentic process where Gemini iteratively generates test cases based on the confirmed understanding, simulating various scenarios and edge cases as a tool for full test coverage.
- Test Case Display and Export: Present the generated test cases in a clear, structured format, allowing users to review, edit, and export them into various formats (e.g., CSV, Jira tickets).
- Compliance Standard Mapping: Automatically map generated test cases to relevant compliance standards (FDA, IEC 62304, etc.) based on identified requirements.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#778DA9) to evoke trust, precision, and analytical rigor.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F1F3F5), nearly white, providing a clean, neutral backdrop that enhances legibility and focus.
- Accent color: Subtle amber (#FFC857), used sparingly for highlighting interactive elements and key information.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif providing a balance of modern aesthetics and readability for both headings and body text.
- Use a set of consistent, professional icons, focused on clarity, simplicity, and recognizability to represent different functions, statuses, and categories.
- Employ a clean, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy, utilizing whitespace effectively to prevent cognitive overload. Maximize data presentation for requirements and tests.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for user interactions (e.g., loading, form submission) to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
